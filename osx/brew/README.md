Run this to reinstall everything in Brewfile

### Misc

Kotlin compiles to a .jar file, which requires a Java Runtime (JVM) to execute.
macOS has a built-in "locator" tool for Java, but it only looks in the
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ folder. Homebrew installs OpenJDK in a
different location (/opt/homebrew/...), so macOS can't find it.

```sh
sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
```
