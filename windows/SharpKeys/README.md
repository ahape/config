# SharpKeys Configuration
SharpKeys is a Windows application that allows you to remap keys on your keyboard. This folder contains a configuration file (`caps_lock_as_ctrl.skl`) that maps your Caps Lock key to act as an additional Control (Ctrl) key.

## How to apply this keyboard mapping:
1. Download and install **SharpKeys**:
   - Go to the official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys)
   - Follow their instructions to install the application.
2. Open the **SharpKeys** application from your Start menu.
3. Click the **Load Keys** button.
4. Select the `caps_lock_as_ctrl.skl` file located in this directory (`windows/SharpKeys`).
5. Click **Write to Registry** to apply the changes to Windows.
6. **Restart your computer** (or log out and log back in) for the changes to take effect.
